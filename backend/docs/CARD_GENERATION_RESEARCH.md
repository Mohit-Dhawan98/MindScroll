# Unsupervised Strategies for Microlearning Card Generation

Microlearning apps break down knowledge into bite-sized **cards** – such as summary cards (key takeaways), flashcards (Q\&A pairs), and quiz cards (multiple-choice or true/false questions). Generating these from full-length books **fully automatically** (with no human input) is challenging due to the volume and complexity of text. Modern NLP provides various unsupervised methods to tackle this, including document chunking, topic modeling, knowledge graph extraction, graph-based summarization, retrieval-augmented generation, and semantic vector search. Below we explore an end-to-end pipeline combining these techniques, and we evaluate the trade-offs and effectiveness of each approach for creating the three card types.

## Document Chunking and Preprocessing

Large books must first be **ingested and split into manageable chunks**. This involves parsing PDFs/ePubs or HTML articles into raw text and then segmenting that text. Common strategies include splitting by chapters or sections if structural markup is available, or by fixed-size blocks of text (e.g. 1000–2000 tokens) that fit within model context windows. Chunking preserves locality of information and ensures that downstream algorithms (topic modeling, summarizers, etc.) can process the text without exceeding memory or token limits. Preprocessing also entails cleaning the text (removing headers, footers, page numbers, and OCR errors) and normalizing formatting. Tools like **Apache Tika** or **PyMuPDF** can extract text from PDFs, while **BeautifulSoup** can parse HTML from web articles. Once raw text is extracted, libraries such as **NLTK** or **spaCy** help with tokenization and sentence splitting.

*Trade-offs:* If chunks are too large, important details might be diluted or lost in averaging; if too small, context is fragmented. A hybrid approach is to chunk by semantic or structural boundaries (e.g. paragraphs, subsections) to preserve meaning. This chunking stage is fundamental for **all three card types** – summary cards need each chunk’s gist, flashcards benefit from isolating facts per chunk, and quiz questions can draw from individual sections. **Overlapping windows** (sliding contexts) can also be used to ensure continuity of information between chunks, at the cost of some redundancy.

## Topic Modeling for Unsupervised Segmentation

**Topic modeling** groups parts of the book into coherent themes without supervision. Classical *Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)* treats each document (or chunk) as a mixture of latent topics and discovers clusters of words representing those topics. LDA is a probabilistic model that uncovers the central themes in a text corpus in an unsupervised manner. However, LDA uses a bag-of-words assumption and may miss semantic nuances. Newer models like **BERTopic** leverage transformer embeddings and clustering to find topics that are more semantically meaningful. BERTopic combines sentence embeddings with dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and clustering (HDBSCAN), then uses class-based TF-IDF to label topics with representative terms. This often yields interpretable topics without needing a predefined number of topics (unlike LDA).

* **For Summary Cards:** Topic modeling ensures **coverage of all major themes** in the book’s summary. By identifying the key topics, one can generate a summary card for each topic cluster, capturing diverse takeaways. For example, if a textbook has topics “Quantum Mechanics” and “Thermodynamics,” topic modeling will separate those sections so each can be summarized distinctly. *Trade-off:* LDA might produce overlapping or generic topics if the book’s language is complex, whereas BERTopic (using embeddings) can better group semantically related content. BERTopic’s richer semantic clustering can improve summary coherence but requires more computational resources (embedding every chunk).

* **For Flashcards:** Topic clusters can guide **question generation** by focusing on one subject area at a time. This prevents redundant flashcards and ensures broad topical coverage. For instance, one could generate a set of Q\&A flashcards for each discovered topic, making sure to cover facts from each cluster. Topic modeling also helps in **organizing flashcards** in a logical order (e.g. grouping cards by chapter or theme). *Trade-off:* LDA’s keywords for a topic might need interpretation to form good questions, whereas BERTopic directly provides clusters of related sentences/paragraphs from which flashcards can be created. The choice may depend on the text: LDA is fast and well-understood, while BERTopic yields more accurate topic groupings for complex prose.

* **For Quiz Cards:** Ensuring quiz questions span different topics improves assessment coverage. Topic modeling can inform a **balanced quiz** by selecting top questions from each topic cluster. It can also adjust difficulty – e.g. niche topics might yield harder questions. *Trade-off:* A potential downside is that a poorly tuned topic model might miss subtle themes, leading to gaps in quiz coverage. However, advanced models (like BERTopic or hierarchical LDA) can detect subtopics; BERTopic even has options for hierarchical topic modeling (merging or splitting topics), which could be leveraged to generate quizzes at varying granularity (chapter-level vs. book-level topics).

**Tools:** For LDA, libraries like **Gensim** or scikit-learn’s LDA implementation are available. For embedding-based topic modeling, **BERTopic** is a ready-to-use Python library that internally uses **SentenceTransformers** for embeddings and can automatically determine the number of clusters. Additionally, **Top2Vec** and **UMAP+HDBSCAN** (the components of BERTopic) can be used directly for custom pipelines. These tools help automatically label topics with keywords, which can later assist in naming the summary cards or guiding question generation.

## Knowledge Graph Construction for Key Facts

A **knowledge graph (KG)** represents information from the book as a network of entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges). This can be constructed via **information extraction** techniques: for example, using dependency parsing or Open Information Extraction to pull out subject–predicate–object triples from sentences. Over an entire book, this yields a graph of how concepts are connected. *Unsupervised KG construction* has been demonstrated in domains like finance, where graphs are extracted from text without human labeling. Such graphs provide a structured summary of knowledge, and can be analyzed to find central nodes (important concepts) or frequently occurring relations.

* **For Summary Cards:** The knowledge graph can reveal the most important facts or relationships in the book. By identifying high-degree nodes or critical connections, we can formulate key takeaways. For instance, if a biography shows frequent relations involving a person and major events (Person → *authored* → Book, Person → *won* → Award), those can be turned into bullet-point facts on a summary card. Unlike purely text-based summarization, a KG-based approach ensures *factual completeness* – it extracts who did what, when, and how, giving a fact-centric summary. One method is to rank nodes/edges by centrality or frequency and then generate summary sentences from them. *Trade-off:* A knowledge graph may struggle with implicit information or require post-processing to be readable. Also, extraction errors (e.g. incorrect relations from complex sentences) can lead to incorrect facts. However, when combined with other summarization methods, KGs can strengthen the factual accuracy of summary cards.

* **For Flashcards:** Knowledge graphs are particularly powerful for generating Q\&A pairs. Each triple (subject, relation, object) is essentially a fact that can be turned into a question. For example, from a triple (“Marie Curie” – *discovered* – “radium”), one can generate a flashcard: **Q:** “Who discovered radium?” **A:** “Marie Curie.” This method is akin to how factual flashcards are manually created. It benefits from unsupervised extraction: important entities and relationships are identified automatically, which can then be phrased as questions. In practice, one might extract all triples and then filter to the most relevant ones (perhaps using the topic modeling clusters to discard trivial facts). *Trade-off:* The quality of flashcards depends on extraction precision. If the KG misses context (e.g., the time or place relevant to a fact), the question might be too vague. Some relationships might not translate well to question form without rephrasing. Nonetheless, using a KG ensures the **answers are grounded in the text’s facts**, reducing the chance of generating unanswerable or irrelevant questions.

* **For Quiz Cards:** KGs can aid in creating **multiple-choice questions and true/false statements** by providing a pool of plausible distractors and factual statements. For a multiple-choice question, the correct answer comes from the knowledge graph (as in the flashcard), and distractors can be chosen as other nodes of the same type or related concepts. For instance, if the correct answer is “radium” for a question on discoveries, one could pull other element names or scientific discoveries from the KG as distractors (ensuring they are *incorrect* for that specific question). Research on distractor generation uses such knowledge bases: e.g. WordNet or ontologies to find synonyms/hyponyms or related entities as distractors. Similarly, for **true/false**: one can take a true triple from the graph and slightly alter one element (say, the object) to create a false statement. For example, from (“Paris” – *is capital of* – “France”) one could generate the false statement “Paris is the capital of *Spain*” (false). *Trade-off:* The challenge is to make distractors **plausible yet wrong**. A knowledge graph provides semantically related entities (like other capitals for the example above) which tend to be good distractors. However, if the graph is incomplete, there might be limited options for distractors, or the distractors might be too obviously unrelated. Also, automated graph extraction might link entities that aren’t truly interchangeable (leading to confusing wrong answers). Combining KG-based distractors with a semantic similarity check (to ensure they fit the context of the question) is a common solution.

**Tools:** To build the KG, one can use NLP pipelines: **spaCy** or **Stanford CoreNLP** for named entity recognition and dependency parsing, or specialized OpenIE tools (e.g. **OpenIE6** or **AllenNLP’s** IE model) to extract triples. Libraries like **NetworkX** can store and analyze the graph (e.g. calculating centrality). For a more production approach, extracted triples could be inserted into a graph database like **Neo4j** or **RDF stores** (via RDFLib) for complex queries (e.g. find all entities of type “Person” connected to “Discovery” relations). For generating questions from triples, simple templating or more advanced **question generation models** (see next section) can be used to turn a triple into a well-phrased question. WordNet can be accessed via **NLTK** to find synonym/hyponym distractors, and libraries like **Python’s wordfreq or conceptnet** can supply common words for distractors if needed.

## Graph-Based and Hierarchical Summarization

Summarizing a full book into concise key points (summary cards) can be approached with **unsupervised extractive summarization** and **hierarchical summarization** techniques:

* **Graph-based Summarization:** Algorithms like **TextRank** represent sentences as nodes in a graph with edges weighted by semantic similarity (e.g. cosine similarity of sentence embeddings or overlapping keywords). By running a ranking algorithm (like PageRank) on this graph, the most “central” sentences are identified as the summary. TextRank is fully unsupervised and often yields good results for *extracting key sentences*, since it doesn’t require training data. The top-ranked sentences from each chapter or from the whole book can serve as the basis of summary cards (possibly paraphrased or trimmed for brevity). *Trade-off:* Purely extractive summaries preserve the original wording (which can be beneficial for accuracy), but they may be disjoint or lack narrative flow when stitched together. Also, a long book might have too many “important” sentences to include; one must choose a subset or further condense them. Graph-based methods struggle with very large inputs since computing pairwise sentence similarities is expensive; applying them per chapter or per topic cluster mitigates this. Nonetheless, they ensure **no critical detail (as per the text) is missed**, which is valuable for unsupervised key takeaways.

* **Hierarchical Summarization:** For very long documents like books, a **multi-level summarization** is effective. This involves *summarizing in stages*: first split the text into sections (chapters, or chunks of a few pages) and summarize each; then summarize those summaries to get a higher-level synopsis. Essentially, the summarization is done recursively or in a pyramid: chunk-level → section-level → book-level. This hierarchical approach preserves the book’s structure and yields a more organized summary. For example, each chapter’s summary could become a slide, and then a further compressed summary of the whole book gives an overview card. *Trade-off:* Abstractive summarization (rewriting in new words) often requires advanced models (which are typically pre-trained on summarization tasks, thus not purely unsupervised, though used without human intervention). A hybrid approach could use extractive methods at lower levels and a **graph or transformer-based summarizer** at the top level. The hierarchy adds complexity to the pipeline, but it prevents the final summary from omitting entire sections of the book. It also allows tuning the level of detail (e.g. one could keep the first-level summaries as more detailed “summary cards” for each chapter, and a second-level ultra-brief summary as an overview card).

* **Beyond Key Takeaways:** Unsupervised summarization can also feed into flashcards and quizzes. The *top-ranked sentences* from TextRank can be converted to questions by blanking out a key phrase (**cloze deletion**) or by asking a direct question about the statement. For instance, a top sentence “The Nile is the longest river in Africa.” could yield a flashcard: Q: “What is the longest river in Africa?” A: “The Nile.” Similarly, these important sentences can form true/false questions (“The Nile is the longest river in Africa. (T/F)”). In this way, graph-based summarization provides a pool of high-value facts for quiz material. *Trade-off:* The sentences chosen might need slight rewriting to make clear questions or to remove any clause that’s not needed. But since TextRank is domain-agnostic and unsupervised, it’s a solid starting point for extracting facts that likely deserve a flashcard or quiz question.

**Tools:** For graph-based summarization, **PyTextRank** (a spaCy plugin) implements TextRank for both keywords and sentence extraction. There’s also the **Sumy** library which offers TextRank, LexRank (another graph algorithm), and LSA for extractive summarization. These can be run on each chunk or chapter. On the other hand, **hierarchical summarization** might be custom-built using a pipeline: one could use an LLM or transformer summarizer (like **Bart-large-CNN** or **Pegasus** on Hugging Face) at each level. Frameworks like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex (GPT Index)** allow chaining of summarization calls (e.g. summarize each part, then summarize the summaries). If sticking to unsupervised methods, one might summarize each chapter with TextRank, then concatenate those summaries and run TextRank again for a book-level summary – effectively an unsupervised hierarchical approach. Another approach is to cluster the first-level summaries by similarity and summarize each cluster (as described in the *Late Chunking* strategy by Weaviate), which merges graph-based and semantic clustering ideas to avoid redundancy. The key is that multiple passes of summarization (and possibly clustering) are used to handle scale.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that marries a generative model (like a large language model) with information retrieval from the source text. The idea is to **retrieve relevant chunks** of the book for a given prompt or question, and provide those to the model so that its output remains grounded in actual content. This approach has gained popularity because it can leverage the fluent language generation of LLMs while keeping the results factual and specific to the book at hand. In our case, we can use RAG to generate each type of card in a more *natural and varied way* than purely extractive methods:

* **For Summary Cards:** Instead of just stitching together or compressing sentences, one can prompt an LLM to *write a summary* of the book or of each chapter. Using RAG, the system first performs a semantic search (using embeddings) to fetch the most important chunks from the book (for example, the introduction and conclusion, plus one representative chunk per topic or chapter). Those texts are fed into the LLM with a prompt like “Using the information provided, summarize the key takeaways of Chapter 1.” The LLM then produces an abstractive summary that is **grounded in the retrieved text**. This method can yield very readable and coherent summaries, often better phrased than raw extractive ones. *Trade-off:* The quality depends on the LLM (larger models like GPT-4 or open-source models like Llama 2). While no human writes the summary, the model itself is trained on large corpora (which is a form of supervised learning at pre-training time). However, because the generation is constrained by retrieved data, the risk of hallucination is reduced. One must ensure the retrieval step covers all main points (topic modeling or headings can guide this retrieval). If the book is very large, multiple RAG calls per section might be needed, which can be computationally expensive. But this approach scales: new books can be processed without manual curation, making it suitable for a production pipeline.

* **For Flashcards (Q\&A):** RAG can assist in **automated question generation**. A straightforward use-case is: for each topic or each significant paragraph, retrieve that chunk and prompt an LLM with, “Generate a question-answer pair based on the following text.” The LLM might produce a factual Q\&A that wasn’t explicitly a sentence in the text but is inferable (for example, turning a statement into a question). Recent research systems have combined summarization, answer extraction, and question generation models to build flashcards. Our approach with RAG can do this in one step by instructing the LLM appropriately. We can also guide it to a style (e.g. *definition flashcards*, “What is the definition of X?” if the text contains a definition; or *concept application*, “Why/How” questions if the text describes a process). *Trade-off:* Using an LLM in generation can introduce errors if the model isn’t properly constrained – e.g., it might pull in outside knowledge not in the text. Mitigating this involves providing only the text chunk and perhaps adding instructions like “Only use the given passage to answer.” The upside is a well-phrased question and answer that feel human-made. If multiple flashcards are generated per chunk, a filtering step might be needed (to remove duplicates or trivial questions). The **diversity** of questions can be enhanced by varying prompts (some focusing on definitions, some on causes/effects, etc.), all while using retrieval to stay on-topic.

* **For Quiz Cards:** RAG is highly effective for **generating distractors and explanations**. One approach: use the LLM to generate a multiple-choice question by providing it a relevant text and asking it to formulate a question with one correct answer (found in text) and 3 incorrect answers *that look plausible*. Because the LLM has a vast knowledge, it can propose convincing distractors (though we should verify they don’t accidentally turn out true in the context). For example, if the text says “Mars is called the Red Planet because of iron oxide,” the model could generate: “Which planet is known as the Red Planet? A) Mars (correct), B) Jupiter, C) Venus, D) Saturn.” The distractors here are all planets, making them plausible – a technique similar to using knowledge bases for distractors, but now the LLM’s internal knowledge plus instructions ensure they are contextually appropriate. Likewise, for true/false, we can ask the model to state a fact from the text and another slightly altered version. *Trade-off:* We need to carefully instruct the model to mark which answer is correct and ensure it only uses information from the book (or general knowledge that doesn’t contradict the book). Another challenge is maintaining difficulty levels – we may instruct the model to produce one easy, one medium, one hard question per chapter, for instance. RAG’s retrieval helps avoid questions on trivial tangents by focusing on central chunks. The reliability of the quiz content can be improved by verifying each generated answer against the vector store (e.g. do a quick semantic search on the proposed answer to see if it appears in context – if not, it might be a hallucination).

**Tools:** Implementing RAG typically involves a **vector database** (see next section) and an LLM API or model. Libraries like **LangChain** provide out-of-the-box chains for retrieval+generation: you can specify a prompt template for QA generation and attach a vector store for retrieval. **Haystack** by deepset is another framework that can do RAG-style pipelines (often used for QA systems, but adaptable to generate flashcards by changing the prompt). For open-source solutions, a model like **FLAN-T5** or **Llama 2** can be run locally and prompted; or for high quality (with cost), OpenAI’s GPT-3.5/GPT-4 via API. The key components are: a retriever (could be **FAISS** or **Weaviate** etc.) and a generator model. The NVIDIA NeMo toolkit and Hugging Face’s Transformers both support RAG implementations as well – for example, Facebook’s original RAG (2020) model can be fine-tuned to accept a knowledge source, though a simpler approach here is just manual retrieval + prompting. In production, one might use RAG to generate a large set of candidate cards offline, then have a human or an automated verifier filter out any low-quality ones, thus ensuring only high-quality cards go to learners.

## Vector Databases for Semantic Organization

Throughout the pipeline, we rely on **vector representations** of text to capture semantic similarity beyond keyword overlap. A **vector database** stores high-dimensional embeddings of text chunks and allows efficient **similarity search**. This is crucial for tasks like retrieving topically related chunks (for RAG or for clustering) and for finding semantically similar sentences (for TextRank or for picking distractors). In essence, vector databases enable **semantic search**, which retrieves text based on meaning rather than exact words. They are optimized to handle millions of embeddings and perform nearest-neighbor lookups quickly, even as the data grows.

In our context:

* After chunking the book, we compute an embedding (e.g. using a **Sentence Transformer** model) for each chunk or even each sentence. These embeddings go into a vector store (like FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate).
* **Topic Modeling:** BERTopic internally uses such embeddings to cluster topics. We could also perform our own clustering by doing a K-means or HDBSCAN on vectors. The vector DB can speed up finding nearest neighbors for each point (useful in HDBSCAN or in interpreting topics by finding exemplar documents).
* **Hierarchical Clustering:** In the hierarchical summarization approach, one step was to cluster first-level summaries via vector similarity. This is essentially using the vector store to group related content before further summarizing.
* **RAG Retrieval:** As described, when generating a card, we query the vector DB with a prompt (or a representation of the topic we want a question on) to get the most relevant source text. The quality of retrieval directly affects generation – a well-tuned embedding model (like *all-MiniLM-L6-v2* or domain-specific models) and a good vector index ensure the model sees the correct supporting text.
* **Distractor selection:** We can encode candidate answers and use the vector store to ensure distractors are close in meaning to the correct answer but not identical. For example, if the correct answer’s embedding is queried, the nearest other entities from the text could serve as distractors (assuming they are of the same type). This adds a semantic check to our earlier KG-based approach – the distractors “feel” similar to the correct answer, increasing the chance a learner might confuse them (which is desirable for a challenging question).

*Trade-offs:* Using a vector database introduces complexity and memory overhead. For a single book, a simple list of embeddings might be manageable without a specialized DB (just use brute-force search). But for scalability – say the app will handle *many* books or very large texts – a vector DB is invaluable. It also allows real-time interactions, like if the app later implements a chatbot to answer questions from the book, the same vector index can be used. One must be cautious about embedding quality; very short text (like one sentence) vs. longer chunks behave differently. Sometimes multiple vector indexes are used at different granularities (paragraph-level for broad retrieval, sentence-level for fine detail). Nevertheless, vector search has become a standard for semantic organization in modern NLP pipelines, powering things like semantic search engines and Q\&A bots – the microlearning pipeline stands to gain the same advantages in organizing and retrieving content by meaning.

**Tools:** Popular vector databases include **FAISS** (an open-source library by Facebook AI for efficient similarity search), **Annoy** (by Spotify, for approximate nearest neighbors), and cloud services like **Pinecone**, **Milvus**, or **Weaviate**. Many of these integrate with Python; for instance, Pinecone has a Python client, Weaviate offers a REST API, and FAISS runs in-memory in Python/C++. Libraries such as **sentence-transformers** provide easy methods to encode text into embeddings (with many pre-trained models available). In practice, one might use `sentence_transformers` to encode all chunks, then load them into a FAISS index with `faiss.IndexFlatIP` (for cosine similarity). For ease of use, **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** abstract a lot of this: you can add documents to an index and query them without dealing with low-level faiss calls. The vector DB not only serves the current task but can be the backbone for **long-term retrieval**, meaning as new content (books/articles) are added to the app, everything goes into a unified semantic index enabling cross-resource recommendations or queries in the future.

## Comparison of Approaches and Overall Architecture

Bringing it all together, an **end-to-end architecture** for a production microlearning app could look like this:

1. **Ingestion & Chunking:** When a new book (PDF, ePub, etc.) is uploaded, the system uses a parser to extract text. It then chunks the text into sections (preserving chapter boundaries and splitting further if chapters are very long). Each chunk is stored with metadata (book name, chapter, chunk index).

2. **Vectorization:** Each chunk gets an embedding via a sentence transformer. All embeddings are stored in a vector database for later retrieval and clustering purposes.

3. **Topic Modeling & Semantic Segmentation:** The system applies an unsupervised topic modeling to the chunks. Using BERTopic is a good choice for versatility – it will output a topic for each chunk and keywords describing each topic. This yields a **topic hierarchy** or at least a set of topics covering the book. We can use this to label sections of the book and ensure the next stages treat each topic adequately. (If the book already has a clear structure like chapters, this step could be optional, but topic modeling can still highlight cross-cutting themes or subtopics within large chapters.)

4. **Knowledge Graph Extraction:** In parallel, an information extraction module scans each chunk’s text to pull out entity relationships (triples). This could be done with a library like spaCy’s dependency matcher or an OpenIE system. The result is a raw knowledge graph of facts mentioned in the book. We might store this graph for use in question generation (it could even be stored in a Neo4j database or similar for complex querying, but a simpler approach is to just keep a list of triples or a dictionary of entity -> facts).

5. **Summary Card Generation:** For each top-level topic or chapter, create a summary:

   * Use **hierarchical summarization**: summarize each chunk in that topic (possibly with a quick extractive method or a first-pass LLM), then summarize those summaries. For example, if a chapter has 10 chunks, get a 3-sentence summary of each chunk, then summarize those 30 sentences into a 5-bullet summary. Graph-based algorithms (TextRank) can do the first pass quickly, and an LLM with RAG can do the final polishing.
   * Alternatively, use **RAG directly**: retrieve the most relevant sentences from the chapter (using the vector DB), feed them to an LLM with “Write a concise summary of ...” prompt. The output would be an abstractive paragraph which we can split into bullet points (one per key idea).
   * Ensure that each summary card highlights names, dates, terms – these often correspond to things that will become flashcards or quiz questions. The system might italicize or bold key terms on the card for the user (some apps do that for emphasis).
   * **Citations:** Because our pipeline knows the source of each chunk, we can trace which chunk contributed which summary sentence. This allows providing citations (useful in some educational apps to build trust that the summary is accurate, much like our answer here cites sources).

6. **Flashcard Generation (Q\&A):** Now generate flashcards focusing on important facts:

   * Use the **knowledge graph**: For each important entity (could be those appearing frequently or appearing in the summary cards), generate a question. If an entity is a concept, ask “What is \[Concept]?” using the definition from the text as the answer. If the entity is involved in an event/relation, ask a wh-question: e.g., from (Marie Curie – discovered – radium) generate “Who discovered radium?”. From (radium – discovered in – 1898) generate “When was radium discovered?”.
   * Use **LLM QG**: For each chunk (or each topic), prompt an LLM to output a set of Q\&A pairs. There are toolkits specifically for this: e.g. the *lmqg* library provides models fine-tuned for question generation that you can use to generate questions along with answers. These models take a paragraph and output likely QA pairs (similar to SQuAD-style questions). One can filter those by checking if the answer actually appears in the text and isn’t too long.
   * Combine and filter: We might now have an overabundance of flashcards. The next step is to remove duplicates and overly trivial questions. We can rank flashcards by some heuristic – e.g., prefer those whose answers are key terms (names, dates, important concepts) rather than generic words. We can also use the **topic clusters** to ensure at least a couple of flashcards from each major topic (coverage criterion).
   * The final flashcard deck could then be organized by topic or difficulty. Each flashcard stores the reference to where its answer was found so that an explanation or link to the source can be given to the user if needed (useful for learning).

7. **Quiz Card Generation (MCQ and T/F):** Build on the flashcards to create quizzes:

   * For each Q\&A flashcard, try making it a multiple-choice question. The question stem is the same; the correct answer is known. We need to generate 3 incorrect options (distractors).

     * **Distractor from KG/Corpus:** Use the knowledge graph or corpus to find entities of the same type. If the question is “Who discovered radium?”, we know the answer is “Marie Curie.” We look up perhaps other scientists from the text (e.g. “Albert Einstein”, “Isaac Newton”, etc.) or from a broader resource if needed. Ensure these were not involved in the discovery of radium (they are just plausible names to someone not sure of the answer). Linguistic resources like WordNet could also supply related terms (for a “what is” question, synonyms or related concepts often make distractors).
     * **Distractor via LLM:** Alternatively, prompt an LLM: “Here is a Q and its correct answer. Provide three plausible wrong answers.” This often yields good results, but one must double-check that none of the “wrong” answers is inadvertently true. The model should be told to use its general knowledge but if the domain is specific, we constrain it to things mentioned in the text.
     * We can also utilize the vector DB: take the correct answer embedding and find near vectors that correspond to other terms in the book. If the book text is rich, similar context terms will appear (for example, other chemical elements might be near “radium” in vector space).
   * For **True/False** questions: we can take either the summary statements or the flashcard facts and flip them. For each fact, create a true statement (the fact itself) and a false one (alter one key detail). The false detail could be chosen by picking another value of the same kind from the KG. E.g., change a date or a name to another from the book. This ensures the false statement isn’t absurd but requires knowledge to disprove. We mark the card as true or false accordingly, and perhaps provide the explanation on the answer side (e.g. “False – actually Paris is the capital of France, not Spain.”).
   * *Trade-off:* MCQs are more complex to generate than binary flashcards, but they add value for self-assessment. We must be careful that distractors are **feasible** (not too easy, not impossible). According to studies, using semantic similarity and knowledge bases to pick distractors improves quality. Our pipeline can incorporate that by design. True/False are simpler but we should avoid ambiguous statements – every generated statement should be clearly true or false by the book’s content.

8. **Review and Ranking:** (Optional but recommended) Incorporate a verification step. For example, use a pre-trained QA model (like a BERT QA) to answer the generated questions using the book text as context – if the model fails to find the answer, that question might be malformed or too hard. Similarly, ensure that each summary bullet is supported by at least one sentence in the text (which we can check via vector search + overlap). This automated review can flag content for a human to review if the application desires a human-in-the-loop for quality control. Many research systems found that automatically generated flashcards approach human quality, but a small portion may be ambiguous, so filtering those improves user experience.

9. **Frontend Organization:** Finally, the app would present:

   * **Summary cards** at the start of a chapter or the whole book (e.g. “Key Takeaways from Chapter 1”).
   * **Flashcards** for drilling – possibly in an interactive review session (the user tries to recall the answer, then taps to reveal it).
   * **Quiz cards** for self-testing – maybe after learning, the user can take a quick quiz generated by the system.
     Each card can be linked to the source text (allowing the learner to read more context if needed). The system might also build a **spaced repetition schedule** around the flashcards, and the vector embeddings could help find related cards or even suggest prerequisite cards from other materials if integrated into a larger knowledge system.

**Toolkits and Libraries:** Summarizing the recommendations:

* *Parsing & Preprocessing:* **PyMuPDF (fitz)** for PDF, **ebooklib** for ePub, **BeautifulSoup4** for HTML, **regex/nltk** for cleaning text.
* *Chunking:* **spaCy** for sentence splitting; custom code for merging sentences into chunks of desired length.
* *Topic Modeling:* **Gensim** for LDA (with pyLDAvis to interpret topics), **BERTopic** for an advanced pipeline, or **scikit-learn NMF/LDA** for quick experimentation.
* *Embeddings:* **SentenceTransformers** (models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for generating embeddings for chunks and sentences.
* *Vector DB:* **FAISS** (in-memory, good for prototyping), or **Weaviate/Pinecone** for managed scalable solutions. Even **ElasticSearch** supports dense vector search now as an alternative in production.
* *Knowledge Graph:* **spaCy** with the **DependencyMatcher** or **Blackstone** (for legal text) or other domain-specific IE tools; **Stanford OpenIE**; or newer approaches like using an LLM to extract triples (there are prompt-based IE methods). Storing KG: **NetworkX** or **Neo4j**.
* *Summarization:* **PyTextRank** for extractive; **Transformers** library with models like BART, T5, Pegasus for abstractive (they can be run in summarization pipeline with no additional training). For hierarchical, one might use **LangChain** to orchestrate multiple summarization calls with a loop or recursion.
* *Question Generation:* **lmqg** (Language Model for Question Generation) toolkit provides ready-to-use models in multiple languages. Also Hugging Face has models like `valhalla/t5-small-qg-prepend` for QG. Alternatively, **Textrunner** or older rule-based could do simple fact-to-question.
* *Distractor Generation:* **NLTK WordNet** for synonym/antonym, **conceptnet** for related concepts, or simply reuse the vector DB to find similar terms. There's research code (e.g. GitHub projects for MCQ generation) that might be leveraged for ideas.
* *LLM Orchestration:* **LangChain** is a convenient framework to tie together vector stores, LLM prompts, and tools. **Haystack** can do a pipeline where you ask a question and it retrieves and answers (which could be inverted for Q generation). **LlamaIndex** is also geared towards creating question-answer pairs from documents and could be adapted for flashcard creation.
* *Evaluation:* **Haystack** also has evaluation components. One could use **BERTScore** or embedding similarity to compare generated summaries/questions with source to ensure alignment. For verifying T/F, simply search the statement in the vector store – if it’s false, it shouldn’t have an exact match; if it’s true, it should.

In summary, an unsupervised (or minimally supervised) pipeline for card generation is achievable by combining **NLP building blocks**: chunking for manageability, topic modeling for coverage, knowledge graphs for facts, summarization for key points, and retrieval-augmented LLMs for fluent generation. Each technique contributes: Topic modeling and KGs provide **structure and knowledge**, graph-based and hierarchical methods ensure **coverage and conciseness**, and RAG with LLMs contributes **fluency and creativity** in the final output. By evaluating the outputs (perhaps with user studies or automated metrics), the system can be refined. Notably, a study on automatically generated flashcards found them close in quality to human-created ones – indicating that with the right mix of these strategies, a production-ready microlearning app can greatly automate content creation and personalization for learners. The trade-offs often come down to precision vs. fluency: purely unsupervised methods (like TextRank, LDA) excel in precision (using only given text) but may lack polish, whereas using vector similarity and LLM generation adds fluency but requires careful grounding. The recommended architecture uses the strengths of each method to balance these trade-offs, delivering a set of summary, flashcard, and quiz cards that are factually accurate, well-organized, and pedagogically useful for end users.

**Sources:** The techniques discussed are drawn from a mix of classic and state-of-the-art research. Topic modeling concepts were referenced from IBM’s overview of LDA and the BERTopic documentation. Knowledge graph use in text summarization and QA is supported by recent NLP research and summarization frameworks. Graph-based summarization is exemplified by the TextRank algorithm. Hierarchical summarization and chunking strategies have been suggested in community and academic discussions. Retrieval-augmented generation is a modern paradigm described by Lewis et al. (2020) and summarised in the NVIDIA AI blog. The importance of vector databases for semantic search is highlighted by sources like KDnuggets. For flashcard generation specifically, the WikiFlash research provides a blueprint combining summarization, QA, and QG models, and question generation toolkits are detailed in ACL 2023 system demos. Finally, methodologies for automatic MCQ generation and distractor selection are synthesized from a recent survey of the field, demonstrating how linguistic and knowledge-based techniques can be applied in our pipeline. Each of these components contributes to the robust, unsupervised creation of microlearning cards.
